# Inbox

This is your capture zone. **Don't overthink it — just dump it here.**

Anything goes: ideas, links, tasks, notes from meetings, things to research, random thoughts.

## Weekly Processing Checklist

During your weekly review, work through everything in this folder:

- [ ] Move notes that belong to an active project → `10 - Projects/`
- [ ] Move reference material → `30 - Resources/`
- [ ] Move notes about ongoing responsibilities → `20 - Areas/`
- [ ] Archive anything no longer relevant → `40 - Archive/`
- [ ] Delete anything truly useless

**Goal: empty inbox by end of weekly review.**
